## ✅ What We’re Collecting — and Why

We are only interested in behavioral data — such as when and how often code is committed, issues are updated, or tasks are completed — not in the actual code, project content, or any sensitive information.

Examples of the data we use:

- Timestamps of commits or issues
- Issue transitions (e.g., from “To Do” to “In Progress”)
- General patterns of collaboration and activity

We do **not** collect:

- Code
- File contents
- Private messages or comments
- Any form of proprietary or business-critical data
