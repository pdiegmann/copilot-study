## 🔐 Respectful and Responsible Data Handling

We know that trust is earned. Here’s what we’re doing to ensure your data is treated with the respect and care it deserves:

- **You are always in control**: You decide if you want to participate, and you can revoke access at any time.
- **Read-only access**: We only request read permissions from GitLab and Jira. We will never change or write anything.
- **Immediate pseudonymization**: Any names or email addresses encountered are automatically and irreversibly hashed — making it impossible to trace data back to any individual.
- **Full transparency**: After the data is collected, you can view and download exactly what we’ve gathered through the self-service portal.
