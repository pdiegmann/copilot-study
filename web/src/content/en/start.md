## ✅ What We’re Collecting — and Why

We are only interested in behavioral data — such as when and how often code is committed, issues are updated, or tasks are completed — not in the actual code, project content, or any sensitive information.

Examples of the data we use:

- Timestamps of commits or issues
- Issue transitions (e.g., from “To Do” to “In Progress”)
- General patterns of collaboration and activity

We do **not** collect:

- Code
- File contents
- Private messages or comments
- Any form of proprietary or business-critical data

## 🔐 Respectful and Responsible Data Handling

We know that trust is earned. Here’s what we’re doing to ensure your data is treated with the respect and care it deserves:

- **You are always in control**: You decide if you want to participate, and you can revoke access at any time.
- **Read-only access**: We only request read permissions from GitLab and Jira. We will never change or write anything.
- **Immediate pseudonymization**: Any names or email addresses encountered are automatically and irreversibly hashed — making it impossible to trace data back to any individual.
- **Full transparency**: After the data is collected, you can view and download exactly what we’ve gathered through the self-service portal.

## 🔍 What’s in it for You?

By participating, you contribute to a better understanding of how AI is transforming programming work — insights that can:

- Inform **better tools** and workflows **tailored to real needs**
- Help organizations **support developers more effectively**
- Strengthen **arguments for or against** certain AI tools with real evidence
- **Highlight the value of human creativity** in an AI-enhanced world

This study is not about evaluation — it’s about understanding change.

## 💬 Questions? Feedback? Concerns?
