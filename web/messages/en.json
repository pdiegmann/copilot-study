    "intro": "Thank you for completing the survey and sharing your thoughts on GitHub Copilot. To gain a deeper and more accurate understanding of how GitHub Copilot is shaping the everyday work of developers, weâ€™re now taking the next step. Beyond perceptions, we want to see how real work practices and routines evolve when developers collaborate with AI tools. For this, we kindly invite you to contribute digital trace data from a tool you already use: GitLab. With your consent, this data will help us uncover meaningful patterns and changes that surveys alone cannot capture. We appreciate your support.",
